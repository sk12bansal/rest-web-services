Best Restful Design Practices

1. Consumer First
2. have great document for rest api
3. make best use of HTTP

4. request methods

GET
PUT
POST
DELETE
5. Response Status

200 - SUCCESS
404 - Resource Not found
400 - BAD Request
201 - created
401 - Unauthorized
500 - server error

6. No secure info in uri
7. use plurals
8. use nouns for resources
9. for exceptions
define a consistent approach

/search
put /gists/{id}/star
delete /gists/{id}/star
